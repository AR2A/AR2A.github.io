<br>The project team RoboCup Rescue participated in the RoboCup German Open in Magdeburg with their robot 'Conrad' for the UAS Hagenberg. The goal of the competition is to navigate the robot through a labyrinth filled with obstacles. The robot either has to navigate autonomously or controlled by a tele operator.
The labyrinth simulates a scenario after a natural catastrophe like an earthquake in which victims are placed in form of dolls. Each doll emits a heat signature sand CO2. A team can score points for detecting the victim in multiple ways (audio-visual). Bonus points can be achieved if the robot is able to sense the heat signature and the CO2 levels. Furthermore QR codes and warning signs are hidden in the area, which reward bonus points when they can be visually detected by the robot. Any misread signs or false warnings lead to score penalties.<br>

<br>The six months old robot 'Conrad' was able to take shortcuts in the arena thanks to its compact design. This way the team could quickly reach the area in which points can be scored. The robot was able to detect the victims most of the times, which left the team and its supervisor satisfied with the result of their work.<br>
