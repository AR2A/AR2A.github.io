## Power Supply

The robot is supplied with voltage by a battery pack. The voltage supply of most of the components is handled by the Intel NUC board via USB. The Intel NUC board itself and the highpower spotlights need 19 V and the Microsoft Kinect 12 V. The previous prototype setup with linear regulator and heat sink has been replaced.
